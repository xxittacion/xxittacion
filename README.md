## Hello searcher, my name is Pavel
**"You know I'm something of a programmer myself"**

**I am from Russia and I live in the city of Yaroslavl**

**"I am a senior front-end developer from the future, as a result of the time jump, my skills fell back to the level of a junior.     
It will take a couple of years of work in the company to restore my skills."**
